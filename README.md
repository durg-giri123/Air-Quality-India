# Air-Quality-India
This project analyzes and visualizes air quality trends across major Indian cities using real-world datasets. With increasing environmental concerns, this project aims to uncover temporal and spatial patterns in air pollution through data cleaning, transformation, and interactive visualization techniques.

🌐 Project Objective

✔️To explore, analyze, and visualize air quality data of Indian cities to:

✔️Understand pollutant trends over time.

✔️Identify cities and seasons with critical air quality issues.

✔️Present interactive and clear visualizations to aid public understanding and policymaking.



🔍 Features

✔️Sourced and cleaned real-world air quality datasets.

✔️Handled missing values, outliers, and performed data transformations.

✔️Engineered features such as AQI category and pollutant concentration averages.

✔️Created interactive charts and time series plots.

✔️Interpreted findings through visual storytelling.




🛠️ Tech Stack

✔️Tool/Library	Purpose

✔️Python	Core programming language

✔️Pandas	Data manipulation and analysis

✔️NumPy	Numerical operations

✔️Matplotlib	Data visualization (static plots)

✔️Seaborn	Statistical visualizations

✔️Plotly	Interactive charts and dashboards

✔️Jupyter Notebook	Development & analysis interface.



📊 Project Workflow (Based on Marking Rubric)

🔹 Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing (30 Marks)

✔️ Identified and sourced air quality datasets (CPCB, Kaggle, OGD India).

✔️ Cleaned data and handled missing values.

✔️ Performed feature engineering (e.g., AQI category, pollutant trends).

✔️ Ensured data integrity and consistency.

✔️ Generated summary statistics and trends.

🔹 Phase 2: Visualization & Interpretation (20 Marks)
✔️ Selected appropriate charts (line graphs, heatmaps, bar charts).

✔️ Designed clear and aesthetically appealing visualizations.

✔️ Integrated interactive elements using Plotly.

✔️ Narrated findings with visual storytelling techniques.
